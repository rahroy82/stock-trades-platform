# Stock Trades Data Platform

This project is a personal, end-to-end data engineering platform for stock trades that I use for trading and investing.

It will eventually include:

- A data lake on cloud storage (AWS S3).
- Ingestion for simulated and/or real stock trade data.
- Curated tables suitable for analytics and dashboards.
- ML-ready feature tables for predictive and classification models.
- A simple web UI to configure which tickers are tracked.
- Room for trade-signal generation and backtesting.
- Infrastructure-as-code for easy deploy/tear-down and temporary demo access.

> Status: Step 1 – project scaffolding and repository layout.
